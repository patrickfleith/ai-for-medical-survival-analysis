# ai-for-medical-survival-analysis
In this project we develop risk models using survival data and a combination of linear and non-linear techniques. The dataset contains survival data of patients with Primary Biliary Cirrhosis (pbc). PBC is an autoimmune disease of the liver caused by a buildup of bile within the liver (cholestasis) that results in damage to the small bile ducts that drain bile from the liver. The goal is to understand the effects of different factors on the survival times of the patients. Along the way it covers the following topics:

- Cox Proportional Hazards
    - Interpreting a Cox Model
- Evaluation of survival model
    - Random Survival Forests
    - Individual Survival Function
